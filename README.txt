Your GitHub Presence
Write a README
Great projects deserve a great README!

It’s like your repository’s homepage

Communicate info you won’t have time for in person

What Goes in it?
Project description

Tech stack

Features

Screenshots

Maybe: instruction on how to install

README How To
Make a file, README.txt, at the root of your project repo

Edit, commit, and push as usual — it shows up automatically as homepage

Fancier: use Markdown for prettier-formatted README

Name the file README.md instead

Markdown Cheat Sheet
